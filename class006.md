## Our Second topic is **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**


1.	What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
Answer:

> 1. Greater efficiency
> 2. Engaged collaboration
> 3. Learning from fellow students
> 4. Social skills
> 5. Job interview readiness
> 6. Work environment readiness

2.	In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

+ Answer: Learning from fellow students is a very good reason for pair programming, as If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area.

3.	How does pair programming work?

+ Answer: pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

> The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
> The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
