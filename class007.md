•	What I have understood from the article, of Julia Rozovsky journey to find her true passion and how she landed her dream job at google to study people’s habits and tendencies and how Project Aristotle the one she was assigned to help her in achieving her goal, is the following:
•	Psychological safety and emotional conversations are integral parts of the success of team working.
•	What also influence the psychological safety are what called group norms.
•	Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.


## Our Second topic is **REST** 

1.	Who is Roy Fielding?

+ Answer:
 > is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. 

2.	Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- Answer: 
> Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern.

3.	What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- Answer:

> HTTP—this protocol is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4.	What does a GET do?
> Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other
5.	What does a POST do?
> If one system needs to add something to another system, 
6.	What does PUT do?
> If a system wants to replace something in another system
7.	What does PATCH do?
> If a system wants to do a partial update
