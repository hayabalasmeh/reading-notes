### What is the dunder or **special** or **magic** methods?

> They are predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes.
 > They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __ init __ or __ str __.

### The uses and enriching those methods provide:

1-**Object Initialization:** __ init __

2-**Object Representation:** __ str __, __ repr __

3-**Iteration:** __ len __, __ getitem __, __ reversed __

4-**Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts:** __ eq__, __ lt__

5-**Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts**: __ add__

6- **Context Manager and adding Support for the With Statement**: __ enter__, __ exit__

## Our second topic is Basic Statistics in Python â€” Probability:

### First what is probability?

- As a term it's the chance of an event happening
- To calculate the probability of an event occurring, we count how many times are event of interest can occur and dividing it by the sample space.
  - What is the sample space ?
  - They are the possible events that could happen

### How statistics and probability related ?

> Given enough data, statistics enables us to calculate probabilities using real-world observations. 
> Probability provides the theory, while statistics provides the tools to test that theory using data.

### The Normal distribution;

- In probability, the normal distribution is a particular distribution of the probability across all of the events. 

### Why the normal distribution is significant to probability and statistics ?

-Because of two factors: 

1-**the Central Limit Theorem**
2-**Three Sigma Rule.**
