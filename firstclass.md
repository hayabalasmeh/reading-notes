## First we will talk about pain vs suffering :

>The greater the growth, the greater the pain.
- This article about pain not any pain, but the one we get in the service of growth gives me an emotional push to be ready to embrace it, as it will launch me forward into the next phase.

## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation
- What I have understood that the big O notation is like a tool to describe or evaluate algorithms or data structures and it has like categories like O(1), O(N), and O(N2). 
- For example O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

## Names and values in python:

- In python we can have many names referring to one value but if any one of these names had been reassigned the others needs to be reassigned too.

- If a value which is been referring to by names or to be more accurate we can call them references , when it’s changed the whole names will be referring to the new value.

- When we say changing a value, meaning we are changing mutable values as the immutable values cannot be changed.

- There are multiple ways for reassigning values other than using the assignment operator for example ; x = something.

- Also, the names or references to a value has no relation to that type of value.
