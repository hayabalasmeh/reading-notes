### First What Is Regression?

- Regression searches for relationships among variables.
- In regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations.
- Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.

### When Do You Need Regression?

- Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. 

### Now , Implementing Linear Regression in python ;

- We can implement it with Python and three open-source packages: 

1- NumPy.

2- scikit-learn ;if you donâ€™t need detailed results and want to use the approach consistent with other regression techniques.

3-statsmodels if you need the advanced statistical parameters of a model

### When performing linear regression in Python, you can follow these steps:

    1- Import the packages and classes you need
    2- Provide data to work with and eventually do appropriate transformations
    3- Create a regression model and fit it with existing data
    4- Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory
    5- Apply the model for predictions
