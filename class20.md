## What main features that Django has and you'll use in almost every web application?

- **URLs**:A URL mapper that is used to redirect HTTP requests to the appropriate view based on the request URL.

- **View**: A view is a request handler function, which receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. 

- **Models**: Models are Python objects that define the structure of an application's data, and provide mechanisms to manage (add, modify, delete) and query records in the database.

- **Templates**: A template is a text file defining the structure or layout of a file (such as an HTML page), with placeholders used to represent actual content,

- **Forms**: HTML Forms are used to collect user data for processing on the server. 

- **User authentication and permissions**: Django includes a robust user authentication and permission system that has been built with security in mind.

- **Caching**: Django provides flexible caching so that you can store all or part of a rendered page so that it doesn't get re-rendered except when necessary.

- **Administration site**: The Django administration site is included by default when you create an app using the basic skeleton. 

- **Serialising data**: Django makes it easy to serialise and serve your data as XML or JSON.
