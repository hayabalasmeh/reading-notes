## Version Control System (VCS)

By utilizing a **Version Control System (VCS)** one can revert a file or project to a previous version, also track modifications and modifying individuals.

*Also*, I think there is like levels of version control system such as Local Version Control, Centralized Version Control, and the last with the most efficiency is the Distributed Version Control.

#### About Git:
 - Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world, also we can define it as a DVCS (Distributed Version Control) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
 - Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.
 - In Git projects we have local repositories ( which consist of Working Directory, Index, Head ) and remote repositories.
