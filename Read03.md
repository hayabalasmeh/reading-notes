##  Getting to Know More about HTML 

 - Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.
 - If I want to add a comment to my code that will not be visible in the user's browser, I can add the text between these characters: **<! - - comments - ->** 
 - The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). 
 - Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other ,we can make this using class attribute which every HTML element can also carry this attribute.
 - The meta element lives inside the head element and contains information about that web page.
 - The div element allows me to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
 - If I want special characters to appear on my page I need to use what are termed "escape" characters because there are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code.
 For example, if I want to include a copyright symbol on a web page I can use either & copy; or &#169;

### The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses
 - HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them such as header, and footer .
 - Another new element is the nav element , which is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
 - The section element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements
