## To simplify the process of learning how to build and design website from scratch you can imagine this process like making car that in order to build the car “Building website” you need to use three languages:

1-**HTML**: It’s an abbreviation for HyperText Markup language. This language help you to structure your webpage and tells the web browser how to display it. You can imagine it as a representative of the car skeleton.

- HTML code consist of what’s called **HTML elements** and it consist of:
  - **Opening tag** ( can contain attributes to add more info about the elements)
  - **Closing tag**. 
  - **The content**.
- In order to write a code in html and to be correctly displayed by the browser you need to write these elements:
    - < !DOCTYPE html >
    - < html >
    - < head></ head >
    - < body></ body>
    - </ html>

2- **CSS**: stands for cascading style sheet and it helps in controlling presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. You can imagine it as the paint of the car.

- CSS uses *rules* to control how the content of elements should be displayed in the browser and it consist of the following:
    - **Selector**.
    - **Declaration block (has the property name and its value)**.
 > Example 
> **p { font-family: Arial;}**
> **p** is the selector while font-family and Arial is the declaration block where font-family is the property name and Arial is its value.

- Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS mostly involves learning the different properties you can use, which they are huge in number.

3-Javascript:
- Javascript make the webpages more **interactive** and **dynamic** which provoke more user interaction. You can imagine it as making the car moves.

- In order to write good code it is better to follow these steps:
    - DEFINE THE GOAL (start by defining the goal you want to achieve by writing the tasks needed for achieving it).
    -  DESIGN THE SCRIPT (write down the steps needed for the computer to follow to perform each task).
    -  CODE EACH STEP (Each of the steps needs to be written in a Javascript programming language).

- Like all languages, you need to know its vocabulary and how to structure your sentences.
    - **Expressions**: which result in value, has -generally speaking-2 types:
          - EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE .
          - EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.
    - **Operators**: characters that create single value from one or more values.
    - Types of operators:
      - Mathematical operators (+,/,*,-)
      - String operator (only the + , example: var fullname = “Haya” + “Balasmeh”, the result would be HayaBalasmeh ).
      - Comparison operators; to compare two values (==,!==,===,!===,<,>).
      - Assignment operator; (=).
      - Logical operators; - We can use it to check the values of more than one expression and return more than one single value (&&,II,!).
    - **Loops**:
       -We can see loops as programming structure to repeat a block of code repeatedly until the condition returns false.
       -We have mainly two types; **While loop**, **For loop**.

- In order to start building the car “the code” you need **tools** to help you in this process “writing code” so for this we can use **Text/Code Editors** ;there are many text editors like Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.

- Consider some features when you choose one such as code completion; Syntax highlighting; and nice variety of themes.
- When you build a car you need like **memo** so to write down the changes you made in order to keep track of your progress and to save your steps , so in case you did something wrong you can return to it to figure out what happened. This implies to the code also, which we call it **Version Control System (VCS)**.
- By utilizing a **Version Control System (VCS)** one can revert a file or project to a previous version, also track modifications and modifying individuals. An example of this system is **Git** that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.

- If you want at the end to sell your car , you might take it to a  car showroom which can help you to show it to other people and that’s what we call it **“GitHub”** which is an online platform help to create websites to showcase a portfolio , project, or anything you want to share without the need for database to setup or server to configure using GitHub pages to share what you create.
