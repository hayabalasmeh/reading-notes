## What is Machine Learning ?

> Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions
> Also, Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems
> The computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify

## Basic elements of great ML;

- Human guidance
- Clean, relevant data
- Avoid overfitting

## There are 5 core steps in ML:

### 1-Exploratory Analysis

 - First, "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.

 #### Why this step is important ?

   - You’ll gain valuable hints for Data Cleaning (which can make or break your models).
   - You’ll think of ideas for Feature Engineering (which can take your models from good to great).
   - You’ll get a "feel" for the dataset, which will help you communicate results and deliver greater impact
    	

### 2-Data Cleaning

 - clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. 
 - Better data beats fancier algorithms.

 #### Common steps to follow:

  - Fixing structural errors
  - handling missing data
  - filtering observations.

    	

### 3-Feature Engineering

 - Help your algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.
 - In other words, “feature engineering” is creating new model input features from your existing ones.
 #### How to apply this step successfully , we have steps to follow:
  - Create Interaction Features
  - Combine Sparse Classes (categorical features)
  - Add Dummy Variables
  - Remove Unused Features
    

### 4-Algorithm Selection

 - Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.
  #### The most effective algorithms typically offer a combination of regularization, automatic feature selection, ability to express nonlinear relationships, and/or ensembling. 
  - Those algorithms include:

    - Lasso regression
    - Ridge regression
    - Elastic-Net
    - Random forest
    - Boosted tree

    

### 5- Model Training

 - Train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you've done the first 4.

 #### How to choose the best model?

  - use these questions to help you pick the winning model:

    - Which model had the best performance on the test set? (performance)
    - Does it perform well across various performance metrics? (robustness)
    - Did it also have (one of) the best cross-validated scores from the training set? (consistency)
    - Does it solve the original business problem? (win condition)
