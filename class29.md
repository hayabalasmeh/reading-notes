## What is Graph?

- A graph is a nodes based data structure those nodes are connected by edges.

### Some terms :
 
 - Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

### Undirected Graphs

- An Undirected Graph does not move in any direction.

### Directed Graphs 

- A Directed Graph where each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

### Complete Graphs

- A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

### Connected

- Where all nodes have at least one edge

### Disconnected

- Where some nodes may not have edges.

### Acyclic Graph

- When a node can be traversed through and can end up back at itself.

### Cyclic Graphs

- When a node can starts and ends at the same vertex.

### Graph Representation

- We represent graphs through:

1- Adjacency Matrix
2- Adjacency List

## Weighted Graphs

- A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges.

## Traversals

- To traverse through a graph we can use two ways:

1- Breadth First
2- Depth First
