## First let's discover the The Caesar Cipher way of encryption

### what is The Caesar Cipher 

> The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.


### Modern ciphers

- In the age of computers, ciphers can't just be hard to crack by an enterprising human; they have to be hard to crack by a computer that can do trillions of calculations per second.

> One of the most common encryption standards is AES-128, a block cipher approved by the federal government and used often for secure file transfer.



### OK now let's discover the meaning of encryption and decryption and code cracking terms

## What those terms mean :

> Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key 

> Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.

> Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.


### Symmetric encryption techniques

- A symmetric encryption is any technique where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest symmetric encryption techniques, and of course, one of the easiest to crack. 


### Asymmetric encryption technique

- Public key encryption to the rescue! It's an asymmetric encryption technique which uses different keys for encryption and decryption, allowing computers over the Internet to securely communicate with each other.
