## Regarding Text Editors:

 - It’s important to write and manage text, especially the text that we write to build a web site and there are many text editors like Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text but choosing a text editor ends up being a personal choice with considering some features such as code completion; Syntax highlighting; a nice variety of themes; and also the ability to choose from a selection of extensions available when you need them.

## Regarding the command line:

 - We can think of it as an addition to GUI more than leaving it behind. A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system.
 - Within a terminal we have what is known as a shell. It is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for us.

## Regarding Basic Navigation &files:

 - Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system so we need to be familiar with certain commands like pwd (stands for Print Working Directory, which tells us what my current or present working directory is),ls (which list the contents of a directory) and cd ( stands for change directory which enable us to move around the system).

 - As for Windows the extension is important, under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is, so it’s an extensionless system. For that, we have a command called file, which we can use to find out that. In addition, everything is a file under Linux even directories.
