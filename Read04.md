## First
#### Quick revision about HTML elements and CSS rules:
- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of a webpage and it consist of :
  - Opening tag ( can contain attributes to add more info about the elements)
  - Closing tag. 
  - The content.
- CSS uses rules to control how the content of elements should be displayed in the browser and it consist of the following:
  - Selector.
  - Declaration block (has the property name and its value).

## Second
#### Let’s jump to Javacript:
  
- Javascript make the webpages more **interactive** by accessing and modifying the content and markup used in a webpage.

#### How to code using Javascript:

 - As tempting as it can be to start coding straightaway, it pays to spend time designing the script (series of instruction the computer will follow to achieve a goal) before start writing it.

 - This could be done through three stages:
   - DEFINE THE GOAL (start by defining the goal you want to achieve by writing the tasks needed for achieving it).
   -  DESIGN THE SCRIPT (write down the steps needed for the computer to follow to perform each task).
   -  CODE EACH STEP (Each of the steps needs to be written in a Javascript programming language).

#### In order to write correct code in Javascript, the following terms need to be known:

- **Expressions**: which result in value, has -generally speaking- 2 types:
   - EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE .
   - EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.
- **Operators**: characters that create single value from one or more values.
  - Types of operators:
      - Mathematical operators (+,/,*,-)
      - String operator (only the + , example: var fullname = “Haya” + “Balasmeh”, the result would be HayaBalasmeh )
