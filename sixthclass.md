## Our first Topic is about Random Module in Python

### What is random module?
- We can say that it can provide you with access to functions that support many operations especially those related to generating random numbers

### Can you give some Examples of those random functions?

1- **Randint**: when you want a random integer, you can use the randint function Randint and it takes two parameters: a lowest and a highest number.
> random . randint (1,8)

2-**Choice**: can often be used for choosing a random element from a list
> random choice(['hi,'hello','hey'])


3-**Shuffle**: shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

4-**Randrange**: will Generate a randomly selected element from range and take the following parameters (start, stop, step )

## That's all for random module let's jump to our next topic.

## Our second topic is Risk analysis in Software Testing;

### Risk analysis in Software Testing is :

1- The process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built.
2- Prioritizing them to test.

### Why use Risk Analysis?
- As to highlights the potential problem areas as it will helps you the to mitigate the risks.

### What are the possible risks that you could encounter?

- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application

### In case to tackle the situation you take the following into consideration:

- Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

- Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

- Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high risk, medium risk, low risk.

### Risk Identification

- There are different types of risks included :

- Business Risks.

- Testing Risks

- Premature Release Risk

- Software Risks

### Risk Assessment

- Early forcast of unwanted situation in your project
- Estimation of potential loss for that situation
- Making decision to deal with such situation
- Avoid the future consequences .

### So How to perform Risk Analysis?
- There are three steps:

- Searching the risk

- Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

- Measures for the risk identified
