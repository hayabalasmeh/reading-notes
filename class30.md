# 7 tips to ace a programming interview:

1- Take a few Minutes:

- wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem.
- Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer:

> “Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”

2- Write down the steps of the solution.

- Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down.
- Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way

3- Write pseudocode first.

- Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode.

4- Don’t sweat the small stuff.

- Programming interviews are about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. 

- If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.

5- Sit down. Be humble.

- It’s an assessment of your programming abilities and if you are able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively

- Also, accept the feedback .

6- Be prepared

- In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.

7- Review your work

- if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.
